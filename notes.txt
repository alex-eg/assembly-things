If you link with ld, kernel won't recognize executable file, because ld doesn't embed ELF header by default.

However, it's possible to link with ld only, but it's not simple.
Here's one useful SO question:

Gcc links crt0.o, that "performs any
initialization work required before calling the program's main
function", according to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0

And thus, argc and argv and argenv are passed as if main was just and
ordinary function, and argc and argv will be in rdi and rsi
respectively.

When you don't link with crt0, argc is on top of the stack ([rsp]),
and all arguments lie after argc, each one is 8-byte pointer, as SysV amd64 ABI dictates.
